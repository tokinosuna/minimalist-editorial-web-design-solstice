## Project Philosophy

The core philosophy of Solstice is to create a seamless, immersive digital experience that feels both minimalist and alive. It's a study in how motion can guide a user's journey and turn a simple portfolio into a memorable interaction. This project is not a theme or a drop-in template, but a starting point for creating unique digital canvases.

## Philosophy of Use & Contribution

Solstice is provided as an open-source foundation for learning and experimentation. While the MIT License grants broad permissions, the spirit of this project encourages **meaningful adaptation**.

You are encouraged to:
-   Fork the repository to create something completely new.
-   Adapt the animation techniques for your own unique projects.
-   Learn from the code structure and improve upon it.

Simple content replacement without significant design or structural changes is discouraged. The goal is to inspire you to build something that reflects your own creative ethos.

## Key Features

-   **Horizontal Scroll Layout:** A smooth, app-like horizontal scroll on desktop, powered by GSAP ScrollTrigger.

-   **Performant Animations:** Built with GSAP for hardware-accelerated, smooth motion design.

## Tech Stack

-   **HTML5 & CSS3** (with Custom Properties for easy styling adjustments)
